# FACE RECOGNITION BASED ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This project is an attendance management system that uses face recognition to mark the attendance of individuals. The system is built using Python and OpenCV, and it uses a Haar Cascade classifier for face detection and a Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) algorithm for face recognition.
### Prerequisites:

To run this project, you need to have the following prerequisites installed:

**Python 3.8:** You can download Python from the official website: [PYTHON.ORG](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.10/python-3.8.10-amd64.exe)

Download and Binary Install The Dlib into Your pc using [DLIB File](https://github.com/2303A51LA7/AIML-PROJECT/blob/b5460638eec18e0917244c78f36539e0dcddf432/DLib%20Binary%20File.whl)

**OpenCV:** You can install OpenCV using pip by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```
pip install opencv-python
```
**Tkinter:** Tkinter is included in the standard Python library, so you don't need to install it separately.

**Pandas:** You can install Pandas using pip by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```
pip install pandas
```
**Numpy:** You can install Numpy using pip by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```
pip install numpy
```
Similarly, Install Remaining Modules:
```
pip install tk-tools

pip install opencv-contrib-python

pip install datetime

pip install pytest-shutil

pip install python-csv

pip install pillow 

pip install times
```
### Running the Project
To run the project, follow these steps:

After Installing Every Module.....

Run the main.py file using the following command:
```
python main.py
```
The attendance management system window will open, and you can start using the system.

### Usage:
### To use the attendance management system, follow these steps:
1.Enter the application by clicking on the "Enter Application" button.

2.Enter the ID and name of the individual in the respective fields.

3.Click on the "Take Images" button to capture images of the individual.

4.Click on the "Save Profile" button to save the profile of the individual.

5.Click on the "Take Attendance" button to start taking attendance.

6.When the camera pops up and identifies the individual, click the space key to take attendance.

7.The attendance will be marked in the "Attendance.csv" file.
